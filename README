This folder contains the genotype networks analyzed by Payne & Wagner
(2014) ``The robustness and evolvability of transcription factor
binding sites." Science, 343, pp. 875-877. 

Data are stored in gml format. For each transcription factor (TF),
there are 5 files. These pertain to the 5 thresholds used to define a
site as bound or unbound ({0.350, 0.375, 0.400, 0.425, 0.450,
0.475}). For all of the analyses reported in the main text, a
threshold of 0.350 was used. Analyses using the other thresholds are
presented in the supplementary online text.

The subfolder mus_genotype_networks contains the genotype networks for
all 104 mouse TFs. The file names are

[TF name]_genotypenetwork_Emin[threshold]_Emax.500.gml

where
[TF name] = Name of TF as taken from UniPROBE.
[threshold] = E-score used to delineate between bound and unbound sites.

The subfolder yeast_genotype_networks contains the genotype networks
for all 89 mouse TFs. For the 43 TFs with protein binding microarray
(PBM) data from two arrays (see supplementary materials and methods),
the file names are 

[TF name]_combined_genotypenetwork_Emin[threshold]_Emax.500.gml

For the 43 TFs with PBM data from one array, the file names are 

[TF name]_11111111_genotypenetwork_Emin[threshold]_Emax.500.gml
